description: My client sells lots of items in Amazon and shipping is managed by Amazon Fulfillment Network. Optimus is an application developed with the aim of cover the overall Fulfillment Inbound Shipment process required by Amazon. It saves the user a lot of time without the need of doing things manually from the Amazon website. Optimus downloads FBA inventory and saves it in our local database. It does the necessary integration with SKUVault to match product SKU's with UPC's. Then the user can easily scan products from within warehouses, the necessary product and box labels are printed automatically and the details of products and boxes are automatically submitted to Amazon. The user can also adjust the inventory units to be always synchronized with SKUVault. Optimus does all of this and much more in the future.

Potential clients come to me and ask how to build an online shop. That's a good question but every case must be analyzed individually. There are plenty of choices and you have to choose the one that fits best for your needs. Typical questions that come up are: Do I have to build one from scratch? How do I promote my products? How do I keep inventory synchronized if I sell from different locations?...

Generally, I differentiate 5 possible situations. I'm going to describe each of them so that it might help to make up your mind based on your own circumstances.

### Full Development

Developing a fully customized ecommerce site is very time-consuming and expensive. You have to design your database of products, implement the logic of the backoffice and the store, design a good template for the storefront, invest time in SEO and marketing, host your application in a server, maintenance,...
It's uncommon that you need to build your online store from scratch, unless you have a high budget and you have special conditions that require to have a site fully customizable.

### Partial Development

There are pre-built storefront packages out there that might require small customizations. This means that you have to implement "only" the backend logic. It's not a minor effort, but at least part of the work is already built for you.
This option, like in the previous, requires developers to set everything up and running so it turnes out to be an expensive choice as well.

A good storefront could be [**Vue storefront**](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) which is based on **Vue** framework. I might talk about it in future posts...

### Prestashop

**Prestashop** is a CMS (Content Management System) to build ecommerce stores. Everything is ready to work out of the box (as long as everything fits by default in your business requirements). It's likely that you have to do some modifications, but at least you have a working ecommerce site from the beginning.
Another advantage is that it's "free". I put quotes because there are some expenses that sometimes are unknown by most of the people.
The package itself is free and open source, but you have expenses like:

- Hosting -> You need a server to host the application. And maybe a domain name if you don't have one yet.
- Setup / Maintenance -> You need somebody with technical profile to install and configure the application initially. Also, in the long term you will need maintenance.
- Payment provider fees -> In order for your clients to be able to pay the items from your website you need to pay a credit card provider or Paypal or whatever you choose to accept clients payments.
- SEO -> You could invest 0 effor in SEO or some thousands of dollars. Whatever your prefer. But this is never ending world if you need to promote your products and be the first in search engine results.
...

I'm not saying that Prestashop is not a good choice, but you have to forget about the concept of "everything is free".
